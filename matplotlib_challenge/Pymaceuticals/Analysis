1. Ramicane and Capomulin saw the best results across all analysis. 
Ramicane saw the best but there might be error considering the sample size 

2. Ketapril is showing WORSE results than the placebo and should really never be used again because it's terrible 

3. Ramicane and Capomulin should be tested again head to head with a larger sample size to determine which one sees
the better results
